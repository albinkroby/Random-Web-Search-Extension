## Technologies Used

## What I Learned

- How to create a browser extension
- Working with Chrome/Edge APIs
- Implementing asynchronous JavaScript operations
- Designing a user-friendly interface for a small-scale application

## Future Improvements

- Implement a feature to save search histories
- Create a more advanced UI with search analytics
